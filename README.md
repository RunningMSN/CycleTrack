# CycleTrack
The current alpha version is located [here](https://medcycletrack.herokuapp.com/).

The evolution of [CycleVis](https://github.com/toofastdan117/Med_School_Cycle_Analyzer),
CycleTrack is a medical school application tracking and visualization system. Our goal is to create
a simple system on which applicants can track the progress of their application cycle while
simoltaneously contributing data that can be used for analytics and assisting future applicants.

## Current TODO List:
 * Make school list page mobile friendly
 * Build infrastructure for visualizing cycles
 * Add import from spreadsheet
 * Add export to spreadsheet
