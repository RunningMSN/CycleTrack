# CycleTrack
The current alpha version is located [here](https://cycletrack.docs2be.org).

The evolution of [CycleVis](https://github.com/toofastdan117/Med_School_Cycle_Analyzer),
CycleTrack is a medical school application tracking and visualization system. Our goal is to create
a simple system on which applicants can track the progress of their application cycle while
simultaneously contributing data that can be used for analytics and assisting future applicants.

## Current TODO List:
 * Add functional line and bar graphs to visualization
 * Fix bug caused by generating graphs without any data
