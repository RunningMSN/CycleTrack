# CycleTrack
The evolution of [CycleVis](https://github.com/toofastdan117/Med_School_Cycle_Analyzer),
CycleTrack is a medical school application tracking and visualization system. Our goal is to create
a simple system on which applicants can track the progress of their application cycle while
simoltaneously contributing data that can be used for analytics and assisting future applicants.

## Current TODO List:
 * Fix bug w/ removing dates from a school on list without having to delete entire school
 * When deleting cycle, delete all schools associated with it
 * Build infrastructure for visualizing cycles
