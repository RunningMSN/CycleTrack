# CycleTrack
Coming soon... The evolution of [CycleVis](https://github.com/toofastdan117/Med_School_Cycle_Analyzer),
this is a medical school application tracking and visualization system. Our goal is to create
a simple system on which applicants can track the progress of their application cycle while
simoltaneously contributing data that can be used for analytics and assisting future applicants.
