            <p>
                CycleTrack does not collect any personal data from general users. Our website does use Google Analytics,
                a web
                analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports traffic to our website. This information is
                used to
                improve content and site performance. Additional information about Google Analytics is provided below.

            <p><strong>Emails and Passwords</strong><br/>
                We use emails and passwords to generate your account and allow you to login. Accounts are necessary for
                each
                applicant to individually track their application cycle(s). We will never disclose your email or
                password to a
                third party. All passwords on this site are encrypted.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Application Cycle Information</strong><br/>
                As a CycleTrack user, you can enter information into our website. All information is entirely voluntary
                for you
                to share. However, certain features may require user input to function. At a basic level, CycleTrack
                accepts
                information about the years you are applying to medical school, schools applied to, and dates of
                application
                actions such as submission, interview received and acceptance dates. Additionally, you may choose to
                enter
                contextual information about your application. This includes demographic information, GPA, MCAT score,
                and
                college coursework.

                How do we use your information?

            <p><strong>CycleTrack User Tools</strong><br/>
                Information about the schools you applied to and application action dates are used to provide you with a
                school
                list tracking interface and visualization generator tool. Coursework information is used for the GPA
                calculator.
            </p>
            <p><strong>CycleTrack Explorer</strong><br/>
                Information about CycleTrack users is aggregated in a de-identified manner to populate the school
                explorer tool.
                The CycleTrack explorer is available to all website visitors and displays information including but not
                limited
                to dates of application actions (e.g. interview invitations) and statistics (e.g. median GPA/MCAT). To
                maintain
                the privacy of our users, we do not display information calculated with a sample size of less than 5
                users.

                profile is
                voluntary and information displayed on a profile is selected by the profile author. Profiles are private
                (only
                accessible to the author) by default and must be published by the user to become publicly accessible.
                The
                CycleTrack team does not monitor the content of profiles, however, inappropriate content is subject to
                removal

            <p><strong>Research/Publications</strong><br/>
                The CycleTrack team may use data provided by users to perform research about medical school admissions.
                Any data
                used for research is de-identified prior to analysis. Findings from CycleTrack research may be published
