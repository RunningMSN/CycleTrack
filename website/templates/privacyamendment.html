    <h4>General Website Visitors:</h4>
    <p>
        CycleTrack does not collect any personal data from general users. Our website does use Google Analytics, a web
        analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports traffic to our website. This information is used to
        improve content and site performance. Additional information about Google Analytics is provided below.

        CycleTrack Registered Users:
    </h4>
    <p><strong>Emails and Passwords</strong><br/>
        We use emails and passwords to generate your account and allow you to login. Accounts are necessary for each
        applicant to individually track their application cycle(s). We will never disclose your email or password to a
        third party. All passwords on this site are encrypted.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Application Cycle Information</strong><br/>
        As a CycleTrack user, you can enter information into our website. All information is entirely voluntary for you
        to share. However, certain features may require user input to function. At a basic level, CycleTrack accepts
        information about the years you are applying to medical school, schools applied to, and dates of application
        actions such as submission, interview received and acceptance dates. Additionally, you may choose to enter
        contextual information about your application. This includes demographic information, GPA, MCAT score, and
        college coursework.

    <h3>
        How do we use your information?
    </h3>
    <p><strong>CycleTrack User Tools</strong><br/>
        Information about the schools you applied to and application action dates are used to provide you with a school
        list tracking interface and visualization generator tool. Coursework information is used for the GPA calculator.
    </p>
    <p><strong>CycleTrack Explorer</strong><br/>
        Information about CycleTrack users is aggregated in a de-identified manner to populate the school explorer tool.
        The CycleTrack explorer is available to all website visitors and displays information including but not limited
        to dates of application actions (e.g. interview invitations) and statistics (e.g. median GPA/MCAT). To maintain
        the privacy of our users, we do not display information calculated with a sample size of less than 5 users.
    </p>
    <p><strong>CycleTrack Profiles</strong><br/>
        CycleTrack profiles allows you to publish a custom summary of your application cycle(s). Creating a profile is
        voluntary and information displayed on a profile is selected by the profile author. Profiles are private (only
        accessible to the author) by default and must be published by the user to become publicly accessible. The
        CycleTrack team does not monitor the content of profiles, however, inappropriate content is subject to removal
        and may be reported by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@cycletrack.org">admin@cycletrack.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Research/Publications</strong><br/>
        The CycleTrack team may use data provided by users to perform research about medical school admissions. Any data
        used for research is de-identified prior to analysis. Findings from CycleTrack research may be published on the
        CycleTrack website, internet forums, social media, or in scholarly journals.
